<h1>PDX API</h1> JSONP API for Portland, OR civic data

h2. About

PDXAPI is a "GeoCouch":http://www.github.com/vmx/couchdb instance populated with data from the City of Portland, Oregon through "CivicApps":http://www.civicapps.org. There are utilities included to convert legacy GIS data such as Shapefiles and load them into CouchDB. Out of the box CouchDB provides a RESTy JSONP API to all of the data.

h2. Using the API

p. See "pdxapi.com":http://pdxapi.com for more information and example usage.

h2. Project Goals

* create an easily consumable data resource for developers interested in utilizing portland civic data
* modify and build upon the city's publicly released data by allowing users to edit and contribute data, and even start whole new datasets
* create automated processes for synchronizing pdxapi with the original data sources (City of Portland, Metro, TriMet)
* create tools and examples for developers to use as a jumping off point for creating 'civic apps'
* emphasize wiki-style revision history and conflict management/dispute resolution when users contribute to datasets

h2. Developers

p. If you want to play around with a local instance, the easiest way to get data from CivicApps is to download lokkju's "pyspatialite":http://code.google.com/p/pyspatialite/ and "pyod":http://code.google.com/p/pyod/ to populate a spatialite enabled .sqlite database with CivicApps data. It should weigh in at around 700mb.

p. You can use the @spatialiteexport@ and @wkt2geojson@ utilities to take the data from spatialite and generate a json file for each dataset. You can then use the @couchpush@ utility to load the YAML files into CouchDB

h2. To-do

* iphone/android example mashup app source code using Titanium
* google maps + jquery mashup app example source code
* better documentation
