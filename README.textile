<h1>PDX API</h1> JSONP API for Portland, OR civic data

h2. Using the API

p. See "pdxapi.com":http://pdxapi.com for more information and example usage

h2. Where does the data come from?

p. Currently the data is being adapted from datasets released on "CivicApps":http://www.civicapps.org.

h2. Project Goals

# create an easily consumable data resource for developers interested in utilizing portland civic data
# create automated processes for synchronizing pdxapi with the original data sources (City of Portland, Metro, TriMet)
# create tools and examples for developers to use as a jumping off point for creating 'civic apps'
# make datasets easy to browse and/or preview for non technical users

h2. Contributing

p. Inside the @data@ directory you will find all of the converted datasets from CivicApps. An easy way to help out is to find a pointfile (more shapefile datatypes will be supported soon!) dataset on CivicApps not yet imported into PDXAPI and format the data in a way similar to the data found in @data@. The key ingredient for spatial datasets is that the coordinates be representing using latitude/longitude. You can use the shp2yaml utility to convert a shapefile directory into a YAML file.

p. To run the API server locally, you will need @ruby@ and @rubygems@ installed, as well as the following gems:
<pre>
  <code>
    sinatra json haml rspec redis
  </code>
</pre>

p. You will also need to install @redis@, which is used to store and query the map data. Once installed, start a redis instance by executing @redis-server@

p. Populate redis with all of the data from the @data@ directory:
<pre>
  <code>
    ruby lib/redisloader.rb
  </code>
</pre>

h2. To-do

# support for polyline/polygon/other shapefile formats
# import 100% of datasets from civic apps
# optimize query speed
# iphone/android example mashup app source code using Titanium
