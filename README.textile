<h1>PDX API</h1> JSONP API for Portland, OR civic data

h2. About

PDXAPI is a "GeoCouch":http://www.github.com/vmx/couchdb instance populated with data from the City of Portland, Oregon through "CivicApps":http://www.civicapps.org.  Out of the box CouchDB provides a RESTy JSON API to all of the data.

h2. Project Goals

* Create an easily consumable data resource for developers interested in utilizing Portland civic data
* Modify and build upon the city's publicly released data by allowing users to edit and contribute data, and even start whole new datasets
* Create automated processes for synchronizing with the original data sources (City of Portland, Metro, TriMet)
* Create tools and examples for developers to use as a jumping off point for creating 'civic apps'
* Wiki-style revision history and conflict management/dispute resolution when users contribute to datasets

h2. Developers

p. See "pdxapi.com":http://pdxapi.com for more information and example usage.

p. The basic usage is to ask PDXAPI for all objects in a database contained within a particular bounding box. You can see an example of this on the PDXAPI.com homepage. You will receive a GeoJSON feature collection that contains any matching objects. Each object consists of some location data and an ID that you can use to look up metadata for the object by asking http://pdxapi.com/@dataset@/@id@

p. If you are interested in working with a local instance of PDXAPI, the included @pdxapi_installer@ file demonstrates how to convert download Shapefiles from CivicApps and load them into GeoCouch. The @old_scripts@ directory contains a bunch of geospatial related utilities developed for PDXAPI that are no longer in use, but may be useful as a reference.
